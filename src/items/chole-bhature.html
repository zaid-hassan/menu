        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chole Bhature is a classic North Indian dish consisting of spicy chickpeas (Chole) served with deep-fried bread (Bhature). 
            This hearty and flavorful dish is known for its rich, tangy, and spicy flavors that come from a blend of aromatic spices and a hint of tanginess from tomatoes and lemon juice. 
            It is often enjoyed as a popular breakfast or lunch dish.
